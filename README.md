# semantic-segmentation-self-driving-cars

In this notebook, we are trying to do semantic segmentation for self driving cars.
The dataset provides data images and labeled semantic segmentations captured via CARLA self-driving car simulator.
The dataset consists of 5000 images along with their 5000 masks.
For this task U-net architecture was trained and the model accuracies were as follows:
      Training Accuracy : 98.93 %
      Validation Accuracy : 98.64 %
      Testing Accuracy : 98.68

The Learning Curves were as follow
